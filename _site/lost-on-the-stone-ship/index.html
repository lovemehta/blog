        <p>In the summer of 2017, I was living in Madrid, Spain. Being new to Spain, my research supervisor suggested me to visit Segovia and Toledo, one weekend, to experience some rich parts of Spanish culture and history.</p>

<p>So where is Segovia and why am I so captivated by this town. Well!! I come from Udaipur, a humble city in western India, formerly the capital of the Mewar Kingdom, also known as the City of Lakes. Let’s not get myself started on Udaipur here. The point is that I come from the land of lakes and palaces and castles. And to my surprise, this elegant aged town of Segovia feels like you are into your own fantasy movie world. There are huge cathedrals, churches and a castle that has been a revelation for a number of films and book fictions.</p>

<h2 id="getting-to-segovia">Getting to Segovia</h2>

<p>Segovia, also identified as the stone ship, is located around 100 km northwest of Madrid in Castile and Leon region of Spain. You can take a bus, a taxi or maybe just go for a drive on your own as its just 100 km and a day trip or a two days stay can get you an enriching encounter you won’t be forgetting anytime shortly.
I took a taxi using the app “BlaBlaCar”, it was a shared taxi and it cost me just 6 Pound Sterling which I guess converts to around 7 Euro. It was a Toyota Toucan and was a really comfy ride. BlaBlaCar has come to my rescue in a lot of road trips and I always try to take one while traveling through Europe as the farmlands are really beautiful there and road trips become balmy due to the views and introspective time you get. I am appending my booking details below.

<h2 id="what-to-see">What to See</h2>

<p>So I took a day trip to Segovia and came back to Madrid by dusk. I walked through the city for a major part of the day and discovered a lot of places. A few of them are listed below. The foremost beauty of Segovia is in getting lost in the town and finding your directions, as it is a small town and everything is convenient on foot.</p>

<p><strong>1. THE SEGOVIA CATHEDRAL</strong><br />
 Throughout my trips in Spain, Portugal, France and other European countries, I had the opportunity to visit numerous cathedrals, churches, monasteries, and basilicas and each one of them is sole, exclusive and admirable in its own fashion. While some are gigantic, some are smaller, some are with many statues and sculptures, some lesser, some are newer, some are older dating back to centuries. This Cathedral is well worth the visit. A Gothic masterpiece with amazing art. The side rooms are a must to see for their paintings and don’t miss the small chapel.</p>

<p><strong>2. SEMANA SANTA SCULPTURE</strong><br />
 While walking I came across this sculpture of the Semana Santa processions. Spanish people celebrate the week before Easter as the holy week or “ La Semana Santa “. It is a profoundly touristic festival. Catholic religious brotherhoods and fraternities perform processions wearing robes and pointed masked caps called “capirotes” on the streets of almost every Spanish city and town.</p>

<p><strong>3. MONUMENTO A JUAN BRAVO</strong><br />
As you proceed from the Roman Aqueduct to the Plaza Mayor you encounter this ambient plaza with several statues and sculptures. What captivates your attention is a moving monument to Juan Bravo, one of the leaders of the Comuneros Revolt against the absolutist regime of Charles V. He lost the battle and was beheaded but is loved here and is a local hero, as the name of the street and the places and restaurants around proposes.

<p><strong>4.ALCAZAR DE SEGOVIA</strong><br />
The Alcázar of Segovia is a medieval alcázar/castle located in the city of Segovia, a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. It gives Segovian skies a Hogwarts style skyline. Actually, the whole city of Segovia seems like a Harry Potter set.

<p><strong>5. MONASTERY OF SANTA MARIA DEL PARAL</strong><br /> 
I walked to this monastery outside the city walls. It is a Roman Catholic Monastery with a great atmosphere. You can find a peaceful environment here and wear off your tiring by sitting by the pond and admiring the castle and the cathedral from here.

<p><strong>6. AQUEDUCT OF SEGOVIA</strong><br />
TThis is an enormous Roman aqueduct, but the photo can’t depict it. It stands through the centuries and they say that Satan built it himself. In reality, they haven’t still dated how old is it. There’s a lot of debate going on between archaeologists regarding the dating of the aqueduct. But for now, let’s just say that Satan himself cast it (#facepalm).
I sat around there for both lunch and dinner. Enjoyed some open-air performances going on and obviously the mesmerizing view with the mind-blowing massiveness of the aqueduct in the background.

<p><strong>7. CASA DE LOS PICOS</strong><br />
A unique house from the 15th century with a facade with 617 granite points &amp; a Renaissance courtyard. It is currently used as the School of Arts building. It is said that the old property was known as “the house of the Jew”, because of the person who held the property being Jewish. When it became the property of a Christian, to change the nickname for which it was known, he decided to single out the facade with the peaks that can be admired today, thus becoming known as “House of the Peaks” or “Casa de Los Picos”.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-eat">Where to Eat</h2>
<p><strong>1. MIRADOR DE LA CANALEJA</strong><br />
 While we climb Cervantes street, and just before reaching the “Casa de Los Picos”, where the Juan Bravo street starts, we find this beautiful balcony, from which we can see part of the city, the church of San Clemente and the hills that surround Segovia. It dates from the 19th century. Right next to the viewpoint there is a cafeteria, if the weather is fine sitting on the terrace tables and enjoying the views of this viewpoint is a fantastic option to make a stop in our walk through Segovia.

<p><strong>2.LA BODEGA DEL BARBERO</strong><br />
 A really quiet place and a really friendly waiter. Must give this place a try for remarkable wine and food. You can find this restaurant a few meters away from the plaza where the Juan Bravo statue stands. The alley connects Calle Juan Bravo with Calle la Alhondiga.

<p><strong>Streets</strong><br />
Segovia has these delightful narrow streets and fascinating architecture around the entire city. The old town is full of character and history. The main attractions are easily accessed on foot via pedestrianized streets lined with lovely shops, cafes, and restaurants. It is an interesting town with twisty medieval streets, Jewish quarter, excellent cathedral and an interesting castle. It just feels like you are in a medieval movie scene with a pinch of royalty in it. I did a walking tour leaving from the Burger King near the bus station at the aqueduct, and this helped me discover things I probably would not have noticed on my own.</p>

<p><strong>Souvenir Shops</strong> <br />
Feel free to stroll around and do all the decorative shopping from this mystical town. Lovely souvenirs can be bought from anywhere in the city from small shops lined up throughout the major streets.</p>

<p>I went there in June. It was a sunny day and wasn’t that warm to tire you down. I loved to walk around the city and enjoyed it a lot. 
<br /></p>

<p>So that’s all I could cover in a day. I know a lot is left to see in this beautiful town. I’ll see you again Segovia, but not yet! not yet!</p>
